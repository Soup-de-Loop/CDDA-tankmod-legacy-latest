This is the last release of Tankmod from the CleverRaven repo, removed after becoming no longer dependent on blazemod because it is still obsolete.

This repo exists purely as a point-in-time of the last officially hosted version in the main repo. 
The original author, ChaosVolt, may choose to host an "updated" version of it on his own repositories, while actual implementation of heavy vehicle stuff will require c++ attention to stand a chance of being a main repo mod or vanilla addition.
